# Limitations

## Android:

- This library requires `SDK >= 24` for Compatibility. It acts as a normal `<View />` on `SDK < 24`
- If you want to drag and drop across different apps, you'll need to have both apps open in `multi-window` mode. Here is a [link](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/drag-drop) to the official documentation.

## Web:

- Dropping multiple media files is fully supported. However, for dragging, it is only available across different instances of `<DragDropContentView />`. For external dragging (to other websites or the desktop), you must pass only a single media file to the `draggableSources`.
- The dropped files will not have `uri` or `path` properties. You can use `base64` or `text` properties to get the file content.

## New Architecture:
- The new architecture can be enabled for Android but not for iOS. This limitation is caused by a bug upstream which is explained [here](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/28040). Although if you do not want to have the touchability for the children of the `DragDropContentView`, you can use the new architecture on iOS as well.
